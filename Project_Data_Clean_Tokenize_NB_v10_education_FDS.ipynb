meaningful relationship with a nice guy however impossible that concept finding anyone meaningful seems to me sometimes im not looking for casual sex im looking for meaningful sex but its not really that important in the big scheme of things as far as im concerned im really looking for a cute respectful kind guy who i can become good friends with and maybe fall in love im very connected and fallow news and current events as well as local bay area history very closely i think its very interesting as the bay area has a very rich history and culture im currently a college student but am off for the summer not working right now trying to focus on college even though i still dont have a real strong idea of what i want to do for a career so for now im taking digital photography classes at the community college known berkeley city collegebcc in downtown berkeley i was majoring in american sign language and had hoped to become an interpreter but doing that for a living is a lot of work and its very difficult and im fearful that might not be what i want or am ment to be doing with my life its typical of people in my age range at this time to really not know what they want to do and with the economy being what it is there is a lot of uncertainty about what to do some students are spending thousands on degrees that will be worthless the day they graduate so im pursuing a liberal arts major which means you do a bit of everything the thing i hate the most about being gay is that for most of the gay community it seems to all be about sex and has nothing to do with finding a relationship with a single person or something consistant and safe instead its like people are trying to fuck each other over at every turn many people in the gay community lacking any form of unity when it comes to treating each other with basic human decency and respect this seems to especially be the case for san francisco i dont own a car and dont plan to own one any time in the near future as ive decided to rely on sustainable forms of public transit such as bicycling trains and buses mass transit is efficient and it would have been really great if general motors hadnt destroyed the efficient public transportation options that existed in the s in the us and instead lobbied to sell slow buses and bulldoze peoples homes and communities for congested ugly interstates and us highways im very mature for my age and very creative im very computer oriented and fairly nerdy but its great living life one day at a time broadening my horizons by visiting new places in the bay area and learning their history im currently working on a degree in multimedia arts for now going out to bay area events and taking tons of photos recently shot bay to breakers playing video games every now and then trying to play catchup for the years i was totally out of the loop riding public transportation and enjoying the views and the experience that comes with it bicycling around the east bay enjoying the beautiful resources the bay area shines with the bay birds flying by cars zipping along i im not entirely sure where ill go or what ill end up doing but i hope its beautiful and rewarding photography communication computers sign language technology growing things gardening bay area transit public transit bicycling videography history of the bay area understanding highway and freeway networks as well as the us interstates state routes and bridges making youtube videos being at the right place at the right time and capturing a video of something terrible like a bus crash or an open door train on muni or a muni driver smoking inside of a muni train collecting things video editing sound editing finding deals and saving money taking lots of showers helping others learning about specific topics that interest me self advocating standing up for whats right and not letting people put me or others down rushing procrastinating sign language editing photos keeping up with current

being at events that involve a large group of people but there are times where i just want to cuddle up next to someone and enjoy a quiet night watching a movie or listening to music it all depends on the mood and the daily stressors during that period of my day week month etc but one thing is for sure i dont like staying indoors for very long i just cant do it i have to go out and do something outside the home even if it means taking a hour stroll on west cliff the funny thing about being a social bug is that im really shy and get flustered easily when im introduced to new situations but as i get used to the new environment ill slowly settle in relax and have fun a los angeles native kind of that has moved and lived in santa cruz for four years and now a resident of redwood city i like to cruise around and check out new places especially bars pubs mum and pop stores bookstores coffee shops and things related to exercising and nature currently im pursuing a phd in clinical psychology with an emphasis in ptsd and traumarelated disorders graduate school will make you hate the subject youre trying to pursue a career in just throwing that out that it is an extremely stressful time where you wont see the benefits until much later nonacademicwise im a dancer im mainly focusing on blues dancing right now ive been told that i take it seriously i just see it as the perfectionist in me that wants to get it right be awesome at it and somehow spread my love of it ive dabbled in east coast swing a class in salsa and burlesques for the summer im going to learn west coast swing how to learn in partner dancing and going back to burlesques and then some also im a moderately bad writer it takes me longer compared to most people to write something out because im constantly correcting

clinical psychology at palo alto university one of my many interests include traumarelated disorders such as ptsd and psychodynamic and humanistic interpretation of relationship issues and selfdevelopment i graduated from uc santa cruz spring i was majoring in intensive psychology with an emphasis on personality psychology the reason that i want to have a career in psychology is because i generally love helping people ive volunteered at various agencies that aid my community such as family service agency i am also interning at various other agencies that include facilitating or cofacilitating group therapies for a wide range of populations such as traumatized children to maladjusted adults cooking as long as i have a recipe nearby beginning follow or as people tell me while dancing singing in my car when no one is around and being a host at a party or get together my heightespecially for an asian woman most asian women are usually shorter than the american average foot inches or less not sure please correct me anyways my height is foot inches and yes i love wearing heels which sadly makes me even taller also my friends tell me that i appear to have an innocent look my only advice isdont let it fool you books most books that involve some type of mythology such as odyssey iliad arabian nights etc movies sybil with sally field tucker and dale vs evil new years resolution watch more movies somehow tv shows the walking dead in treatment and various anime music i like all kinds of music such as sigur ros jonsi owl city jason mraz the postal service jack johnson queens of the stone age aural vampire bjork death cab for cutie incubus marvin gaye massive attack muse ok go pendulum queen and red hot chili peppers aside from the above im slowly getting

have some fun itll either be about dancing video gaming watching shows or anime hanging out with friends etc etc other times im trying to figure out new ways to improve my dancing or see if i can do

the best qualities in people i associate myself with i love to be challenged by different concepts i love analyzing literary works for my self i love challenging other peoples standpoints in life i am a very intricate and a complex human being i am very meticulous in details and am a very scholastic person i like perfections and get upset and disappointed when i dont follow through with tasks or other things to perfection it is very hard to forgive myself at times i also have a high system of valuesthey are often challenged but i try to be tolerant and compassionate towards people i am highly sophisticated and phylosophical love class elegance and definitely intelligence however i am very critical of my surroundings at the same time so watch outif you could put up with me maybe its your luck oh yeah and one other detail that i cannot include in my details i am a jew for jesus let me tell you what that means it means that i wholeheartedly believe that jesus is my salvation gods only begotten son who has died on the cross for our sins and offers salvation for absolutely no cost to you i have strong jewish upbringings and yes i believe that jesus is the one and only i have overwhelming experience that has proved that he is the one and only jesus is the god trinity in one if you dont understand how it works you better start exploring because he would eventually lead you to an understanding if you would be open to exploring it go to church get the new testament and read the old testament has overwhelming details of jesuss coming and he will be coming back soon and judge the world the old testament is the new testament concealed and the new testament is the old testament revealed however he is waiting on you to start exploring him do not start telling me that i am religious religion and spirituality are two different things spirituality deals with the persons heart and mind religion is twisted added subtracted misinterpreted by men who are decieved by satan satan is real and if you dont have jesus you are very vulnerable to satans decieving you which makes you sin and inobedient to gods will god has prepared a plan for all of us and we need to trust only him which is god jesus he will protect you from all evil but first you must internalize jesus in your heart and mind and develop an intimate loving relationship with god which yes you can develop start asking questions start asking why things happen to you start exploring your surroundings and start wondering about god i pray that he would draw you close to himself just as he drew me love you

when they get to know me they notice my complete honestyi am like an open book however it doesnt mean it could be taken advantage of very easily i am not a conventional type of a girli am not what you

personality i cant remember who said it but its been said that all relationships are based on shared experiences and texting over the internet doesnt seem like much of an experience so if you think maybe you might like to meet eventually then thats bonus points in my book edit im running out of steam when it comes to online interaction i know its almost a taboo in our culture to meet someone from the internet after learning very little about them but its so much faster and more effective to just meetup assuming i were an evil person out to do bad things i dont have magic powers that make you come with me to a dangerous place or anything like that if we meet in person at a coffee shop there is very little risk being run there i say this because i am terrible online im bad at whatever it is you need to do to keep someone interested in person im much better im a great deal more experienced in face to face communication body language is great and tonetiming are what i rely on to actually be funny at all that being the key ingredient to the majority of human relations it can be hard for me to make much of a connection through text so all that being said if youd like to meet in person please just tell me i wont get weird about it or be scared off however if you want to talk first thats fine too just im bad at reading between the lines when there are actually lines of text to be read between so if youre genuinely interested dont be afraid to be blunt about it in fact id prefer it i enjoy debate i used to say arguing but people assume the wrong thing when i say arguing im referring to the dictionary definition no aggression or anything like that intended im not really here to make new friends im ok with making new friends thats just not why im here making friends in person seems to work out better anyway im actually on this site because my appearance and attitude in real life cause me to make an inaccurate first impression part of it seems to be that i look it runs in my family to look very young this would be nice if i were but im just about so its really more of a detriment at this point im pretty bad at small talk im good at big talk or the deeper things philosophy is one of my biggest passions but most people dont actually want to have a philosophical conversation theyd rather talk about the weather or sports or something equally safe and easy to think about i can small talk about a few things video games movies comics art technology or science but that tends to lead to bigger conversations i cant just talk about how tron legacy was mediocre i end up getting into the moral implications of mass ai murder and the scientific craziness that bringing an ai program to life and somehow manifesting it a functioning humanoid body would entail that shits crazy yo also what the hell tron writers so tron is gonna be bad in this one yeah awesome alright well tron is a badass like an unquestionable badass what do we do to let the protagonist beat him oh no man dont worry hell have a change of heart and it wont be tied to anything particular in the story hell just suddenly have the force of will to overwrite his corrupt code and eff up the baddie not a single inconsistency there interesting thing when something really sad or upsetting happens to me my first reaction is to laugh my ass off more than cry or anything else this has developed recently dunno why of the books ive read were written by english guys as a result ive got an unusual amount of brittish in my head its not outwardly evident just something about me everyone seems to have one of these so my myers brigg thingy is intj working on becoming a d animator maybe an illustrator i just like design and movement and d art so anything in that area would be great providing perspective a lot of people say theyre good at giving advice but i think that its much more effective to provide as much perspective and information as you can to a person really when you help people with their problems i think the best thing to do is just help them think rather than helping them decide video games being honest having proper arguments not fights conversations with opposing points of view im also good at climbing things dont know why but ive always enjoyed climbing the typically unclimbed stop lights for example it used to say art up at the top of this part but that doesnt quite cover it i spent my life from age to age extremely focused on drawing specifically and art in general so im really good at that proofs in the profile pictures people have said i sound near exactly like micheal sera though not usually until someone brings it up personally i cant hear it but its my voice so im different i act different i look different i think differently this puts a lot of people off those few that it doesnt bother seem to end up being the people im closest to in life books by douglas adams also terry pratchett dude has like books out and ive been reading them all one by one i think i have left movies id say i love animation but i also like sci fi though the recent sci fi sucks i like anything with a really well choreographed fight scene also making fun of bad movies is plenty of fun or watching other people make fun of bad movies a la rifftrax breaking bad is the best show right now in my opinion for comedies youve got your rocks and your communitys i learned to absolutely love mash when i was a little insomniac kid who watched tv all night because he couldnt sleep prodigy eminem the kraken from the potc soundtrack lots more oooh but my favorite song ever is around the world by daft punk its repetitive as hell and as a result actually kind of bad but its beat matches both my heart rate and my steps when im walking most places as a result it feels like i have my own personal theme song i like mochi caramel brownies pizza other stuff im a media vacuum so i actually love all kinds of movies and music and tv so ive narrowed these down to my most favorite of each category video games i play them theyre awesome other people should also play them my computer art science video games my family is pretty great the use of my arms thats an important one dogs i love dogs theyre just plain awesome d production technique the cooler people i know anything my brain randomly decides is obsession worthy like that little bit of paint thats coming off the wall that ill eventually turn into a giant patch of missing paint metaphorically speaking recently my friend helped me realize that i have a tunnel vision approach to most of life i do few things at a time but i do those things with so much dedication thought and often times passion that it makes it worth the sacrifice of whatever else i could have been doing as well recently i realized a good word for this is fixation i fixate all the time its almost the only way i get anything done hanging with my friends or working diligently on a project im up for anything but my friends and i are mostly poor and we like video games so we dont have reason to do other things anything which sounds weird but why i dont have anything to hide and if you ask about anything i would think youd be prepared to hear the answer so its not a social thing whats the deal with being all closed off and mysterious those people kinda seem like jerks to me heres one that seems relevant though im a very low grade high functioning autistic as a result i dont have a lot of innate understanding in regards to social interaction im not socially incompetent though i just go about social interaction differently than other people however it does present a problem for me i dont let loose because as an autistic my example of letting loose involves a lot of staring at people and memorizing their faces and then probably huggingcuddling them this isnt really private but it doesnt seem to be appropriate for anywhere else i guess i should say something about what im looking for a girl who doesnt hate video games and is willing to wade through the awkward part before we really know each other you werent scared away by my profile seriously message me why not also if you feel like you could critique my profile and help me represent myself a little better im very conscious of how i come off but im not very knowledgeable of it also if you want someone to play vidjagames with im an avid

enough adjectives there i used to be majorly obsessed with the mbti personality index a phase which a great many other intps have gone through i still fit the intp description almost perfectly but i hold the test in a slightly lower regard considering how often i meet people who just dont fit into one of their neat types anyway im a third year uc berkeley student mostly just here for fun i work for a preschool assisting with the teaching of two year olds which i adore i have a major yarn problem which i attempt to justify by knitting constantly i turn every conversation into a deep philosophical discussion because i am more comfortable on that plane than on small talk ill add some quotes i really like in this section because i think you can know a lot about a person by their favorite quotes quotations to laugh often and much to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty to find the best in others to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child a garden patch or a redeemed social condition to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded i must learn to love the fool in me the one who feels too much talks too much takes too many chances wins sometimes and loses often lacks selfcontrol loves and hates hurts and gets hurt promises and breaks promises laughs and cries it alone protects me against that utterly selfcontrolled masterful tyrant whom i also harbor and who would rob me of human aliveness humility and dignity but for my fool i do not fear death i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience

making paper snowflakes jewelry making design of many sorts procrastinating selfdeprecatory humor and its subset exaggerated selfaggrandizing humor parenthesis abuse general abuse of the english language at first glance people tend to think im hyper feminine since i do things traditionally construed as feminine like baking cakes being generally crafty knitting and liking children i dont think that image tells the whole story of who i am even though it is all true i would also love to have a discussion about how masculinity is more valued than femininity in our culture first of all im going to scare almost everyone away by coming out as hating music im sorry im completely tone deaf though it is more complicated than that and find music unpleasant so i avoid when possible my favorite foods are cheese and cake but not cheese cake because it is neither cheesy nor cakey i bake and decorate cakes quite often but i dont make cheese maybe someday i love memento serenity the prestige inception monty python and the holy grail pans labyrinth and amelie as far as books go there are way too many to list but i love nonfiction i collect old books but also have a kindle that gets a lot of use the library used to have a book sale on thursdays with five cent books i got such amazing stuff i literally used to bring a shopping cart with me now alas it is gone forever and i have to hunt for books elsewhere here is a list of fiction i like in roughly chronological order from childhood watership down the lovely bones the face on the milk carton the prophesy of the gems the count of monte cristo crime and punishment the lord of the rings blue is for nightmares elsewhere a girl named disaster inkheart eragon veronika decides to die his dark materials the brothers karamazov the mixedup files of mrs basil e frankweiler harry potter tuesdays with morrie kino no tabi lolita the complete plays of sarah kane as far as nonfiction goes some of my favorites are a short history of nearly everything the pig that wants to be eaten the duck that won the lottery trex and the crater of doom physics for future presidents unweaving the rainbow maps of time the caged virgin and infidel

things i enjoy in life and perhaps that will give you some insite on the type of person i am if you want to put a label on me i think nerdyhipster would be most fitting but who likes labels i am a huge music dude i play the drums and a little guitar i have a little bit of knowledge about other instruments but studying percussion is my main thang i try to take it pretty seriously on guitar i mainly play folkcountryacoustic stuff and on drums i mainly play jazzbluesprogrock i can sorta kinda sing also i am a bass and not a good one at that so my range is rather limited but i sing in the car and in the shower a lot i am not currently in a band but i have a tightnit group of friends who just love to jam i enjoy mixing music as well along with a little bit of dj stuff i also love to dance i dance like a fool think thom yorke at concerts i am always the asshole who is dancing the whole time it bugs the shit out of me to sit still at a concert when i look around at everyone who is just standing and listening i dont get it even really ambient or chill stuff i still like to groove to i like to go dancing with friends as well i dont mean raving i am not entirely opposed to the idea but i have never gone im talking about hodowns and swing dancing i am not very good at dancing but that has never stopped me i also am really into filmmaking ever since i was old enough to hold a camera i have been making movies it would be a really cool career path but im just not sure how practical it is i have gotten really into animation as well both d and d i used to make clamations when i was little and it scratched this animation itch of mine recently i have been getting into poetry and photography as well i stumbled upon my greatgrandfathers camera from and it takes some pretty bitchen pics i love the outdoors i try to go on hikes weekly as well as bike rides but sometimes life gets in the way i try to practice yoga and meditation daily and i am a pescatarian i am also really into frolf and ultimate i have a dog and a cat my pup is afraid of my kitty though but then again so am i sometimes im not an actor but i play one on tv i can be rathersilly i am chugging along

taking a lot of fun classes such as sound mixing black and white photography and d animation i am going to be transferring into jack baskin school of engineering at ucsc but their application process for that particular school is quite competitive so it seems as though it might be another year before i transfer fall of sad face i am a barista at starbucks i also work at an after school youth program for middle school kids i do music for this program and play games it is good fun but at times i feel like i am just one of the kids running around singing and playing my dream job would be to make more interactive music experiences i think it creates a compelling and different way to appreciate music to be involved some how in the process this is a fairly undeveloped area of work so i dont know necessarily if it would be a consistant paying job but anyways here are some examples of what i am talking about as interactive music baroqueme thewildernessdowntowncom wwwrome wwwsprawlcom

why not or im just saying seems like an arbitrary number to me music music is such a huge part of my life i almost always have music on in the background yet i also consider to listening to music as a full engaging activity i will often sit with a cup of tea and listen to a couple albums with that being where my full attention lies almost every time i listen to a record i can pick out something new to focus on i will concentrate so much on such minute things such as the way the reverb cuts out on vocals or the way a snare drum resonates i will often point out how much i appreciate something small like this in a mix to a friend but their opinion is hardly as enthusiastic as mine music feeds me in a way that food can not when i am playing music i get in a trance it is similar to a runners high i have probably become an addict at this point but it seems like a healthy enough activity to be dependent on if i havent played music in a while i am eagerly awaiting to get my next fix conversationpeople i love conversing after almost every conversation i have with the exception of those insanely awkward ones i am surprised at how much time has passed even if i will never see someone again ie random dude at a party i will engage way too much time talking to someone to learn some fascinating things about them nature nature man incredible when i spend too much time in the city i just need to escape when isolated in the middle of nowhere there is something so relaxing knowing that there is no one around for miles nothing feels better than overlooking a great vista and letting out a primal howl meditation both meditation and yoga are a daily part of my routine whenever i skip this daily practice i feel on edge and more spacey i just seem more aware of my surrounding and more content after some meditation i am not a real religious guy but i do feel a certain spiritual sensation while meditating good walking shoesboots i have bad arches in my feet i love hiking and walking i need some shoes with some good arch support new things to learn if somebody finds it interesting i probably do too i absolutely love learning i am sort of anxious about what my life will be

lose this isnt fly fishing for christ sake i am indeed quite jaded unfortunately for good reason mind you and although not an unhappy person quite doubtful that there is a man on this internetdatingwebsite who will show me a slice of reality that hasnt already been just slapped on my plate like a cold fish ill just say im not your typical first date so before we get to that point you should at least attempt to understand my atypical nature that in mind ill respect the principle of convenience by continuing with what i am not i am not perfect nor am i cocky spiteful angry flamboyant materialistic ignorant desperate dispassionate or conceited somewhere in my pride im sure lays an air of arrogance at times but im self aware and am certainly not the least accomplished or distinguished individual romping around these hilly streets im sure that i could type up some words to make myself seem like regular prince charming but no one really wants to here my life story so ill stick to the usual rhetoric im looking for a man men le gasp you say a man is that really all you seek could it be anybody well thats a small sentence with a lot of implication fellas i mean masculinity really is such an indefinable facet of the male psyche what does it really mean to be a man as much as the answer to that question is changing every single day i cant help but postulate over what my subconscious has projected onto my reality as an attractive masculine man i mean if i were to really stop and think bout it what draws me toward men perhaps its the physical appeal something powerful capable sexual aggressive and muscular another body in tune and knowledgable of what my body can do and wants done perhaps just what the modern male represents something assertive formidable confident and independent or maybe the idea of being with someone who can understand the way i think more clearly and being capable of a level of connectivity thats seemingly incomparable by sharing that level of masculine identity and indulging in one another look at me gettin all hot and bothered just thinking about this sultry characters silhouette standing in my doorway i want a man to make my skin raise with the slightest touch a man i respect and desire a classy cat with a kick in his step a cool repose in general circumstances retaining a flash of insanity and wild unpredictability who can stimulate my subtly kinky nature as well as my transcended mind i can not deny that my heart pumps a bit harder around a low voice a fit physic a real smile and a happy confidence a heavily sardonic intellectual that has a sick sense of humor who can sit down and talk about the world get a little deep talk about the stars or laugh uncontrollably yet also be able to pin me down get a little rough and show me that they want me without hesitation self doubt or regret thats what being a man is about to me balance being able to balance my dominant country boy masculine alfalike tendencies and arrogance with sensibility and intelligence communication culture and restraint balancing who i am and who i am expected to be between what i am and what i expect myself to be i want a man who gives a damn who is down to this earth open minded ruggedly handsome imperfect self aware connected to his mind and his libido funny as fuck and sharp as a tack high standards you say so be it i have a lot to offer and im willing to wait for him hit me up if your looking for a partner in crime a best friend and a lover a man to be proud of im doing everything with my life that i want to be and more to find out what all that is youll have to dig a bit deeper find out my height eyes smile laugh opinions hahaha i love all kinds of movies haha i wont attempt to define my tastes my music preference ranges through a wide variety i wont hate on music unless its gangster rap or country music hah and food i am a foodie i love to cook and im damn good at it six things i could never do without family friends sex education sanity passion i spend a considerable amount of time contemplating the complexities of life the universe spirituality our world and the institutions which control it aswell as the ways that i can improve myself and the world around me ive got brains and balls im wild agressive and sexual but do not let that outweigh my intellect intuition sensibility and ability to remain monogamous one of my good friends told me this conner you just need to find a man whos a really good guy but also likea bad boyyou need a badass with morals

million facts about themselves and hope something sticks to the wall instead of telling you the essence of what theyre really about people say im really funny and tend to laugh whenever i tell jokes im really sarcastic at all times my sense of humor is kind of dark and cruel except for i love thats what she said jokes i like to laugh and show off my dimples i am a basketball fanatic i play all lot and have been an la lakers fan since as long as i can remember living in the city i like to peoplewatch to see the funny dumb things people do food is one of my passions i like to bake cook and go to restaurants and try new foods i really like to cook for other people maybe i can cook for you some time im a very versatile person i get along well with lots of people i can dress up very sharp too lol and go a social event or to the theater real theater not movies or put on some athletic gear and hang and feel comfortable in either setting i am an extremely passionate person in all aspects of life whether it be music cooking or my job i give everything i do my utmost effort hopefully you can be a part of this i love a good debate and i love grammar like i said before telling jokes is another thing i am really good at people always seem to laugh at the things i say but that may just be because im crazy or something fingers crossed like i said to start im looking for more than just a pretty face i want a girl that can enjoy a witty intellectual sometimes intense conversation the more existential the conversation the better theres nothing i like more than having a conversation that starts with noticing someones earrings to turning into a discussion about the vestibular system that ends in cracking jokes about how much of a nerd i really am i want someone that knows what they like and what they are passionate about and isnt afraid to stand up for it but also is open to new experiences i really like going for random aimless walks with no particular destination so if you like to do that too you get bonus points in my book as far as appearance is concerned im pretty open as to what i want most women are beautiful in one way or another i usually do prefer taller girls in the and above range but please dont think ill reject you if youre shorter if youre a flake or someone who wants to get by on their looks alone please move on thats not what im looking for i want someone special and you should message me if you are as special on the inside as you are on the outside my favorite quote love me or hate me at least you care about me i am working at a nonprofit in san francisco serving underprivileged youth and going to school at sf state i major in exercise and movement science i would like to join the fight against childhood obesity some day i am really good at making people laugh that is my best skill i think also cooking board games scrabble and risk and monopoly are my favorites basketball baseball and i love debate dont try to get into a battle of wits with me if you are unarmed i am a pretty competitive person so i like doing things i can beat somebody at i wear bright outlandish clothing a lot so people probably notice that sometimes i spraypaint my shoes i usually start off most conversations with some kind of joke in order to try to make a good impression too and of course they notice that i am very good looking right i am a music lover my favorite contemporary artist right now is kanye west i listen to queen all the time too i also like ratatat and a lot of s soul music curtis mayfield otis redding marvin gaye sy the family stone i could go on forever however i like old rock like creedence clearwater revival too so my musical taste is all over the place i am a harry potter trivia champion if you dont believe me ask me anything about any of the books george carlin also writes awesome books right now i spend more time reading my school textbooks more than anything else trying to impersonate the good students i love to cook so any kind of food is good with me pretty much as long as i can learn how to cook it i love baking so anything sweet is my favorite i am a root beer aficionado also music i always have my headphones on when im out in publici go crazy if and when they stop working so i always carry a backup pair or two candy any and all kinds of candy make me happy if i were forced to choose a favorite it would be nerdsor maybe gummy wormsor peanut clustersor chocolate covered gummy bears or maybe i really just love all kinds of candy bacon i love candy and we all know bacon is the candy of meats proprioception i trip one time every day for some reason but i never fall because my proprioception is so impeccable or does the fact that i trip every day mean it is bad basketball loved the la lakers since i was born and dont plan on apologizing for it any time soon i love playing the game as well and its the best sport other than hockey to go see in person a pancreas i wouldnt be able to break down starches or emulcify fats without it i love the little guy life in general and hypocrisies of society also cooking my work basketball what my acceptance speech would be like if i ever won some big award like a nobel peace prize or something how badly i wish the ending to the harry potter series wasnt such a letdown everybody should have died cooking or going bowling or looking for a place with an open pool table which i have found by the way otherwise relaxing at home most of the time this doesnt mean i dont like going out though i definitely do enjoy going out for some reason i just dont seem to get around to it as much as i would like when school is in session well you have to ask for that dont you really though i admit that i always say exactly what is on my mind no matter what that subject may be im not one to mince words like i said earlier if you are more than just a pretty face i want someone whos just as pretty on the inside as on the outside and i cant emphasize

       "  'sex and gender are often used interchangably i know that it is difficult to provide such an option but i hope i do not mislead anyone while i was born male i am transgender and so i identify as a woman and dress like one at this point in my life due to lack of funds i am preop so i still have male genitalia but i have already started on hormones and eventually i will have saved up enough money to get surgery if you arent okay with the idea of someones whole body changing over time stop reading this profile now as anyone else who doesnt fit the norm can probably relate to growing up was difficult especially the formative middle school high school years i didnt have many friends and i have never had a real relationship as a result i am very shy and reserved to the point that i passively deter other people in public im invisible so to speak the internet gives me a voice though it gives me the power to express who i am without the threat of immediate social or physical rejection people can get to know me much more comfortably reading and writing words on a screen is easy this is my first dating site but i have high hopes and i hope to meet someone who can fulfill them i have an obscure and fairly useless associate of arts degree from college of san mateo in the hopes of being able to get a degree that employers will actually look at without laughing i am attending a fouryear university as a fulltime student i still have some time to go since i am also holding on to two parttime jobs my major is business administration with a concentration in marketing however my main interest in life has always been video games and that is where i hope to ultimately land a dream job even if i had to begin in some other department like marketing just being a part of the industry would be great after college i dunno what will happen a lot of us college kids dont know anymore whats going to happen the world is pretty uncertain right now i have an offer for fulltime employment but its a deadend job that i dont wantso do i take it for the money or keep firm on my dreams of a video game job i just dont know cooking i have been making meals for my family for many years now maybe eight years or even more i dont really remember its one of those things that you get trained in as a kid and then one day its your responsibilityyou know while a lot of my dishes are asian i can also do some typical american stuff i know that not everyone loves oriental flavors i am pretty good at academics especially english math and science are not my favorite subjects but i do not lack skill in those departments either somewhat ironically english is the subject i dislike above all others it is terrible to be good at something and not like to do it video games are another big passion of mine i have been playing ever since i was a little kid maybe or years old i still remember my dads old bricksized gameboy which i would play with sometimes nowadays due to a lack of funds i generally stick to the retro gaming circuitalthough if one were to get into japanese games such as visual novels and such i do try to keep up with those overall though being good at video games is a subjective thing i have never won tournaments or been a world champion or anything but when you play as much as i have and as often as i do its hard not to attain some level of skill giant list of games that i playhave played in no particular order im only listing things that ive played to a reasonable degree eg beat the game and without cheating like ive played the legend of zelda link to the past ocarina of time majoras mask but i cheated my way through them if you playhave played any of these games i would love to hear from you strong indicates one of my alltime favorites

game not an arcade game super mario world iii welpi know im still forgetting some but thats like of them ill update this as i play new games in the future people always notice my appearance first especially when i am outside of san francisco even when i go out fully dressed and try to pass as a woman my outfits are a little outrageous im overly fond of pink things for example even if they clash with the rest of my outfit high heels and boots of all kinds are another passion of mine no matter how impractical i have run across busy intersections in heels before in front of oncoming traffic and i really do mean high inches inches even inches or more i dont own anything lower i also have a fondness for leather regardless of the weather its raining i dont care umbrellas will fix it degrees outside i dont care id rather sweat than look boring to top it off i have hair that is almost down to my waist even in san francisco you just dont see that too often especially on males all of this combines to make for a pretty distinctive profile im someone that sticks out of the crowd people always stare at me and give me a wide berthwhether they are merely curious or downright disapproving i dont know but in any case i guess i intimidate them books i have two entire bookcases stuffed full of amazing books how am i supposed to pick any particular ones most recently i have read garth nixs the abhorsen chronicles and i am currently reading lamb the gospel according to biff christs childhood friend or some such title its long movies im not much of a moviegoer so my stuff is all old my top favorite movies of all time would probably be wag the dog unlimited blade works and spaceballs shows i dont watch television not even on hulu or whatever tv is just a boring activity for me the closest i will ever get to watching it is animebut even then im not a regular viewer i just obtain the entire seasons put the episodes on my computer and watch at my leisure some of my favorite animes are code geass fate stay night and ygotas yugioh the abridged series music im immature i know it and im not afraid to admit it my favorite music of all time video game rap nerdcore is produced by duane and brando look them up at your own peril other than that i am also a fan of jethro tull move and flumpool i dont really follow artists or bands though i just listen to random stuff and if i like it it goes on the playlist so i have a lot of random things i like but they dont fall under an easy label like this band or that genre i guess you could say i like the music from a lot of video games but even then theres a lot of different games my final fantasy album is probably the largest one though nobuo uematsu is sogood food oh where to start i like all kinds of food and at the same time im a picky eater i like chinese japanese thai vietnamese korean hawaiian american italian cajun southern seafood vegetarian if i had to pick any one thing that i like above all else though it would come down to either shrimp or clamsmussels not that many places serve mussels i just cant get enough of those in no particular order the internet particularly communications like instant messaging and email my favorite stuffed animal its a sunfish mola mola video pc games mountain dew coffee shoes especially boots and high heels and boots with high heels skirts and panties bras are overrated myself being transgender gives me a lot to think about on a daily basis and also as a bigpicture kind of thing what am i going to wear today for example or what was gods purpose for me well i guess a lot of people wonder things like that so maybe its not so different everyone wants to find out who they are and why they were born into the world i think its just a little more difficult for people like me since society in general doesnt look favorably on us even among more liberal circles we are tolerated but not accepted more often than not i also think about the world and life in general it comes naturally from questioning my own existance in a lot of ways the world is worse off now than it has been for many years im not a doomsday advocate but there is a certain appeal to the notion that humanity is on the decline all the crazy things that keep showing up in the newspeople who are only out for themselves no one is acting in the best interest of the public or the world who is thinking ahead to the future there was a great curtis comic strip i read in the sunday comics once the gist of it was that we should cry when babies are born into this unfortunate world and celebrate when people die and go to heaven while some would say it is macabre i think it is kind of true given the current world it made me think at any rate which is more than i can say for most comics probably sitting alone in front of my laptopmonitor playing a video game possibly also drinking because you know depressants make for a fun time i dont know about you but i find that pretty sad im working on changing it though you can help i have a shopping problem it goes by various names but the most common is probably retail therapy when im feeling down i go out and buy something to make myself feel better at least temporarily usually its shoes you play have played any game that i listed above especially one that i am currently playing notation im serious if anything else at all about me seems interestingfeel free to message me i make it a policy to reply to every message to elaborate on what im looking for i dont care if you are a guy or a girl although i heavily prefer girlsalways have or what your sexual orientation is as long as youre not too young and not too old and are relatively close to san francisco im open to anything in an ideal situation i would love to be able to find a longterm partner to be with but seeing as i still have very few friends and am a virgin i would be totally okay with just having sex or being friendsgoing out to do stuff together meeting anyone at all is better than being lonely night after night if you just want to be a longdistance penpal then of course it doesnt matter how far away you live while i am okay with being friends with someone who is already in a relationship please dont contact me for datingsex if you arent single i dont need to create more trouble in my life with potential love triangles jealousy attacks etc finally in regards to sex i have to mention again that i am preop i still have male genitalia what that informations means is up to your own decision based on your sexual orientation all i will say is that i am open to giving and receivingbut i prefer to receive',\n",

adventures trying new things going to a ton of shows every weekend a terrific family and awesome friends im currently enrolled in one summer school class and waiting for the fishing to pick up and looking for some small work on the side i dont have any fuckin tattoos or piercings although i do think they are pretty sweet and i may get em someday until then i will still be more badass and hardcore than you unless you are a bad enough dude to hit yourself in the dick with a hammer up until this point in my life i have just assumed that i will eventually meet somebody that i really like but after a while i realized that waiting for life to happen to me wasnt going to get me anywhere and that if i wanted something i had to try my best to make it happen i have decided that i need to try and create some new types of relationships that were never part of my life or high up on my priorities before the idea of getting into a serious relationship with a girl i really care about is something that at this point in my life is really important to me but being young and not having had any serious long term relationships before i need to find out exactly what girl is right for me although my initial instincts are to find somebody exactly like me as long as they didnt look like me i realize that would make for a boring time at this point i couldnt say for sure whether i want an open relationship or a monogamy but no matter what it is i would like something long term and consistent and with plenty of honesty this will give you an idea of how i am if you were to get down with some other fellas or ladies i wouldnt want you to hide it no matter what and id at least want a sexy story out of it i have a tumblr that i have sorta stopped using httpunfucktheworldstumblrcom

interdisciplinary which is something that i like something that i am not doing right this moment but is still a big part of my life is my job which you may have inferred from my pictures is fishing it satisfies my urge to work hard get my hands dirty and make an honest dollar for a days work although i have my fair share of reasonable complaints about my job i truly enjoy being out on the water and shootin the shit all day with cool people i am currently raising training a dog she is about months old at this point and she is half rhodesian ridgeback one quarter boxer and one quarter german shepherd at this point she is a real handful one hobbysport that i have been diving deeper into in the past year is marksmanship i dont aspire to be in the olympics or anything like that but i enjoy target shooting here and there on the weekends at chabot rifle range it totally satisfies my urge to tinker with cool gadgets and set goals for myself marksmanship is something that i really want to

mind smile shows would be doctor who torchwood black books monty pythons flying circus supernatural daily show colbert report firefly venture brothers aqua teen community eureka warehouse and essentially all others that would fall under the relative genres of the aforementioned examples musically speaking i love all genres aside that from mainstream rap and country i have a wide collection of rock ranging throughout subgenres of punkrock classic modern bluesrock etc i also am a huge lover of blues from old such as muddy water keb mo and chicago based blues to more modern compositions such as that of the seatbelts i started out in triphopindustrial and punk with my first albums being placebo massive attack and bad religion those bands will always be close to my heart i have branched out from there to love the buzzcocks the clash the ramones dow jones and the industrials portishead future sound of london dead kennedys etc i also grew up in the midwest and so i do have a love for classic rock such as that of acdc guns n roses jimi hendrix from this i got into janis joplin iron maiden black sabbath ozzie osbourne def lepperd the rolling stones the who led zeppelin zz

love was i dont want to pull out an old photo album i want to point across the room and say shes sitting right there i think thats beautiful and real ive changed it slightly it was a ladys profile but i mean thats what most people want if theyre painfully honest with themselves right ok so about me this comes up a lot so ill just go ahead and say im halfirish and halflebanese if you know what a lebanon is extra points if not i wont keep you in suspense its a small country in the middle east so im halfarabic yes i know i look white genetics is funny like that i dont yell at the people im closest to like never so if you need someone to yell at you to be happy if thats how you argue look elsewhere because im not that guy and youde be surprised to find out just how many people need this ive recently found out i need that not to happen to be happy im very easy going for the most part there are problems in every situation involving two people but the successful ones work them out constructively and peacefully thats what i want its about respect you know im not that guy that calls days after a date if you like someone why wait the worst thing that can happen is that they dont feel the same and thats not so bad to find out early on you know i dont believe in playing at being aloof i dont play games and i cant respect those that do i chose drinks socially up there only because theres no drinks on occasion with family or friends but is usually the guy who gets that call at am option i have a big heart and im very generous i very rarely spend a lot of money on myself because im always spending it on the people i care about i like planning things out but i also like being spontaneous and showing the other person i care by being a little unpredictable and i appreciate a partner who is the same way i like dates when we get to the restaurant when its full and spend so much time talking that we dont even notice when its closing time and everyones gone home i like talking until am about whatever and while were talking about the phone i always call when i say im going to and i appreciate the same in return again respect and courtesy sensing a theme yet i like when im dating someone and she calls me when she has a nightmare i dont know a guy who doesnt like being the hero i like when random mishaps happen and both people say oh well hey its a memory and with that being said i love creating memories photographs beautiful moments etc im not a hopeless romantic but i like to think im comfortably close thats how i would describe myself but since everyone asks how would your friends describe you they describe me as being a well rounded guy im pretty good with my hands and i know how to fix a car and a computer equally well and im regularly called on to do both haha im actually objectively against paying money for someone else to fix anything unless its a wreck which may be a plus or a minus depending on how you look at it p my formal education is in linguistics and i love studying languages im into sports especially soccer football and baseball but im also kind of a nerd i have been studying krav maga its a kind of martial art from israel for much of my adult life and boxing for the rest and i absolutely believe in standing up for those i care about physically or otherwise im loyal to a fault and ill always have your back thick or thin no matter what its just a thing also im not pushy i think two people need a bit of space to be themselves but its right when they miss eachother when the others not around and isnt that feeling just wonderful ok so a quick word on religion i identify catholic but i was raised within both the roman catholic church and the maronite church ive traveled a lot and seen a lot of things so i take what you would call a broad spectrum approach to religion i honestly dont care what a prospective partner might be so long as she believes in something so what am i looking for its better to describe what im not looking for thats much more important i think if you or your friends describe you as a vixen or wild look elsewhere im just not that guy i never have been its not that i dont like to have fun ive been known to dance randomly in public its just that im past that i dont need someone in my life who likes to go to the club all the time i dont think its fun more than sparingly and like i said if you need conflict or aggression to be happy im not your guy lastly please do yourself and everyone on here a favor and make sure you are completely over and done with your ex boyfriends or ex husband or whatever we all have scars and thats ok but you shouldnt let them rule you extra points if you like bollywood d i work in sales and business development for a successful tech startup outside of that i enjoy bettering myself obviously languages are a huge thing for me and i spend a lot of time learning new ones and improving the ones i already have i practice krav maga i like to read a lot and im huge into technology yes i built my computer reading people and languages im currently learning hindi and its dialects especially punjabi and malayalam my eyes theyre grey and im told thats pretty rare books i enjoy science fiction and anything historical specifically concerning the middle east my current coffee table book is arabian nights movies again these tend to fall into the scifi and historical genres ill cop to star wars being my favorite of all time bollywood is a passion i like to think its a secret but im sure everyone knows p shows i dont watch a lot of tv i like some of fxs lineup like justified and archer ill catch gangland on spike when i get a chance the big bang theory just became an obsession music rock and top i enjoy middle eastern stuff too

       "  'currently working around the clock to get my sailboat outfitted and ready to begin an indefinite sailing voyage around the globe each morning is a little like groundhog day california islands this summer mexico in the fall central america sometime this winter then most likely heading west to the south pacific or south to chile not sure yet that said serious dating isnt exactly in the cards for me but im always down to meet great new people and hey who knows a little while back former hilarious student of mine made me a cd with the song below and said this song is totally you i guess she was right httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvntrxewcamufeatureyoutube_gdata_player that being said in as few words as possible surfer sailor skier snowboarder backpacker photographer teacher shipwright coach traveler climber of rocks lover of life i dont define myself by what i do but how i live live simply live deeply smile laugh love learn explore and teach by what im doing with my life most people probably want to know what i do for a living well i dont necessarily live to work nor do i work to live i somehow manage to survive by doing the things i love and getting paid for it more often than not this includes working as a sailing instructor charter captain photographer shipwright and a lot of other stuff in varying proportions im a romantic i make an effort each day to live a little more simply and to enjoy the little things i like to laugh especially when things go wrong i have an adventurous heart i dont know what i would do without the mountains and ocean i need regular doses of sun and salt water to function coffee also helps in that regard i probably have more fun than anyone youve ever met i love the outdoors i like to cook i love to eat im a man of few words a thinker and a problem solver caring sensitive honest respectful loyal and humble i like to work with my hands am a perfectionist at times but slowly learning that the term good enough has its time and place my plans are made in jello i am a huge fan of the concept of island time i have a goofy side tend to be a bit clumsy at times and if i were a dog id probably be a golden retriever p i live on my sailboat if you are wondering what it is like it is basically upscale camping on the ocean only you feel like youre in a log cabin its the homiest feeling home ive ever lived in you are encouraged to live simply and in the moment i love it most of my free time is spent working on the boat getting it ready to sail around the world it is a lot of work but the lifestyle that it makes available to you is the closest i can imagine to true freedom an opportunity to experience the world for what it really is while contributing whatever is is you have to give in exchange and perhaps more importantly learn about yourself discovering who you really are outside of the paradigm created by our society if its not obvious yet travel is important to me immersing myself in other cultures with the opportunity to learn is when i feel most alive and at home developing a new paradigm based on first hand experience a better understanding of what the real world is like experience the beauty suffering serenity majesty joy corruption and pain develop an understanding of what is right and what is wrong all relative i know so that i can have a better understanding of how to best utilize my skills passions and abilities to make a positive impact in this world and if this sounds like a bunch of selfrighteous crap to you im not going to lie the lure of surfing warm empty waves in the south pacific and skiing powder in new zealand and alaska is definitely a draw my boards are packed some fun needs to be had do i want to live on a sailboat forever no probably not i have to admit the idea of settling down on a farm on the coastal hills of new zealand with horses dogs kids and chickens has a certain appeal in terms of relationships i should say that i fully understand and embrace the fact that relationships are built on compromise good honest communication is also hugely important to me ideally i would like to find someone with a similar zest for life that shares similar interests and values that person might love the feeling of waking up early brewing some fresh coffee in the french press and watching the sunrise maybe go for a good hike wouldnt be afraid to grab a wrench and figure out how things work would actually be stoked doing so possibly crank up some classical music and varnish imagining they are living centuries ago preparing a ship for a long exploration of an unknown world be totally happy exploring a new anchorage for the weekend or if it were winter theyd be totally down for for road trips to mammoth for skiingboarding and think dogs are awesome over analyzing things like these questions keeping calm in gnarly situations turning leftovers and a seemingly impossible ingredient selection into pretty incredible spreads i can cook up a tasty feast recognizing the things im not really good at going through life with a smile on my face growing a gnarly grizzly adams beard a jack of all trades master of few but really good at some that im not wearing any shoes books some current reads steinbecks log of the sea of cortez within the frame girl with the dragon tattoo series a collection of nietzsche a short history of nearly everything two on

company of good friends a delicious homemade meal or play a game of cards under the warm glow of the kerosene lantern listening to the patter of rain on the decks food i like to eat yes i do i love to cook too but i have to admit cooking for one person gets pretty boring real fast i probably havent eaten fast food in years i could go without meat not without fish i generally eat really healthy i

sourdough is still a challenge it is entertaining to me and relaxing i view every ingredient as a crutch meat is a crutch dairy is a crutch im an omnivore but if i cant cook well for vegetarians and vegans i cant claim to be a good cook i play fewer video games than some of my friends and i play the piano to relaxthough i rarely have time if im alone i might even sing alongbut no i am not in a band take that hipster assumptions i also referee for the bay area roller derby and have a rather serious karaoke habit also i really think okcupid profiles should ask people what they dont like and what theyre bad at because that sort of selfdisclosure probably says more than these answers i hate the word foodie i just really care a lot about food and am really good at making it and i hate the word feminist ive spent a lot of time thinking about privilege and equality and have determined that while most feminists are pretty close to correct optimizing for the best future doesnt need its own word i prefer the term reasonable and yes almost all of my friends have been calling me muffin since the end of the last century boycalledmuffin is both a scholar and a gentleman in fact he is a fine

from here im also chronically cheerful though so take my positivity with a grain of salt if shit happens ill probably have fun anyway turning a phrase arguing about anything for no good reason i dont get loud or angry when i argueits more like a hobby im also very polite about shutting up when asked umi can twiddle my thumbs in different directionsi play a decent game of scrabble and can appreciate good coffee and good beer the hawaiian shirt probably i switched to an allhawaiian wardrobe a few years back because people consistently said they liked them when i wore them so ive got a pretty decent selection so no im not a hipster im posthip personalitywise people tend to either notice that im cheerful and hilarious arrogant or maybe bothi try to walk the line most people seem to end up liking or at least tolerating me eventually though i dont read as much fiction as i should i loved the madeline lengle books as a kid and for some reason i read the whole little house series like times everyone loves the hitchhikers series i among them i think back on high school sometimes and all of that tom clancy i readi am entirely prepared to captain a submarine in a clandestine war with the ussr i have other useless skills too ive almost never actually disliked a book the one book i couldnt finish was the fountainhead then that grad school thing happened and i read so so so so many papers and failed to read fiction hoping to work on that soon i havent seen as many movies as i used to i like the weird and hardtounderstand movies brazil memento naked lunch lost highway and clever comedy people being dumb jackass is dumb clever people being dumb cleverly monty python is clever dumb and dumber was brilliant i listen to classic rockstyle music billy joel is great so is traffic i also appreciate a recent quantity of new music andrew bird of montreal and the decemberists and if you want darker i definitely appreciated a lot of the early marilyn manson and the earlyandrecent nin back in high schooli guess thats a pretty wide variety or lighter prog rock stuff like yes im making my way through david bowies prefame workthose albums need listenthroughs each before you get it it seems im not sure these bands would get along if in a bar together ive also fully accepted karaoke at the bar as a hobby and im slowly working my way through the songbooks meat loaf also rocks for both music and foodi love almost all food ethnically indian foods my favorite the less creamy south indian stuff with greek and cajun tied for a close second but ill cook anything out of curiosity i love bacon and tofu i can tell the difference between hot sauce thats tasty and stuff thats just spicy i also appreciate tencent ramen and kraftaroni so dont take me for a food

whiskey for a long time until i realized i just disliked whiskey made from cornso scotch and rye are my friends now on the negative side i hate mayonnaise also a bad interaction with a homeopathic doctor at the age of destroyed my taste for milk i dont like plain milk or ice cream though im still pro on other creamy things and of course i love cheese my friends say i remind them a lot of alton

       "  'i am a bay area native one of the few and the proud i lived in chicago for a while for school lived abroad for two years for the peace corps travelled the world for a year and i have been back for about years now and loving it im glad i took the opportunity to live elsewhere because now i know how good it really is in the bay area i would describe myself as an optimistic intelligent and motivated person i love learning new things and being outdoors for example two short term goals are learning how to make wine and doing a century ride on my bike both very doable i think i also love travelling abroad and exploring new places and cultures ive been to every continent now for my latest trip i spent two months in china i wanted to do something really cool and adventurous and china sounded like the most adventurous place i could go i didnt know a word of chinese when i arrived but it turned out to be an awesome trip in the future i would really like to sail from san francisco up to alaska that may have to wait a while though until i can afford my own sailboat i got my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering but instead of finding a real job like everyone else on more or less a whim and a little encouragement from my sister i decided to join the peace corps i was sent to teach math and science in namibia in southwestern africa kudos if you know where that is while teaching i learned just how difficult it was for my students to succeed at school resources such as books desks and chalk were lacking and after school my students had to spend all their time doing chores like fetching water and gathering wood as a result i got really interested in environmental issues especially water resources when i came back i decided to switch my focus and got a masters degree in environmental engineering after that i worked for couple of years at an environmental engineering consulting firm and then for the government i didnt find either of those jobs fulfilling so i am back at school to get a phd i just started the program this year but so far i am really enjoying it every day is exciting and different i am learning a lot and i get paid to be here life making good meals out of simple ingredients learning new languages making people laugh and feel welcome i also have a long list of sports and activities that i like to do but i wouldnt say that i am good at any of them these things include sailing surfing windsurfing brewing beer making cheese playing the guitar playing the banjo building electronics projects travelling playing rugby rock climbing and cooking basically i love trying new things probably that im tall and thin i have colorful eyes and i have nice teeth yes i have been told i have nice teeth however maybe there are other things let me know what you notice unfortunately i dont get to do a lot of casual reading i started cutting for stone about a month ago and even though its really good i just never seem to find the time to finish it the same goes for newspapers in fact the daily show and colbert report is how i normally get my news i am not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing recently i have been watching a lot of the old star trek shows yes nerd alert do you dare read on i am a big of scifi fan but never watched this show as a kid i didnt realize how good they were and now with netflix and hulu its so easy to vegout and watch three or four episodes at once other shows i am into but dont watch as much are mongrels dexter downton abbey and rock for food i really like ethnic dishes such as thai ethiopian or indian the spicier the better while i can appreciate a good steak now and then i am not really a meat and potatoes type of guy i want flavor when i go out im also a fan of hoppy beers and red wine im assuming this doesnt include basic necessities like food water clothing and shelter so here is a list of my favorite nonessential things mint tea calms me down after a long day cell phone surprise surprise bicycle i can do without my car but not a bike cheese cheese sandwich yes please peanut butter i eat this stuff straight out of the jar jersey sheets they are sooo soft my research im still trying to figure out what exactly my dissertation will be about luckily im still in my first year so its not imperative that i figure it out soon i also spend a lot of time thinking about want i want to do after graduation do i stay in academia start a company work in a research lab once again i have plenty of time to figure this one out as well that depends on what kind of week i had if it was a rough one i am probably relaxing at home watching a movie on netflix otherwise i will be hanging with friends in pa or the city what i said before in the favorite books tv shows movies section that is i like watching the original star trek series i know its geeky you have a good sense of humor you have your life more or less in order you like the outdoors and live a healthy

sonoma county and i also lived in hollywood for music school and austin texas to play music and bartend before moving to emeryville im back in the bay and loving it i know next to nothing about emeryville though does anyone here want to show me any secret spots whats interesting in emeryville i seem to spend all my time in oakland where i work as a video editor in the happy whovilleesque grand lake area preparing footage for trial or other applications recently my company has started taking on more extravagant projects outside of the legal field which has boosted my enthusiasm and pushed me to excel in my av business i like my music loud i vacuum wearing ear plugs im not a vegetarian but i love vegetables especially homegrown by me or family farmers markets good too lately my hikes are trips around lake merritt and my biking is nonexistent i live in an artist coop with a bunch of successful artists whos work you may have seen all over the east bay and beyond they are a

if that means anything to you im not yet sure what it even means to me i think it just means im shy and weird and since im pretty sure being weird is the new normal nowadays its pretty much just a matter of being outgoing or not i only ever think im being weird when im trying to be outgoing in a situation im not comfortable in in which i am not comfortable any english majors out there i know this i do better in small groups than i do in large social gatherings i prefer strong personal connections with just a couple of people or even oneonone maybe its my fascination with the human condition i dunno and lastly i have a lovehate relationship with commas punctuation in general oh and i have no idea how semicolons work im a video editor and a drummer and sometime bartender i have an amazingly fortunate life just minus the fortune its okay thats coming i have a wonderful family i have some great friends i like spending time with them lets see not making lists even though i

enjoyed more than once the bourne trilogy im a sucker for a good reluctanthero action flick the gods must be crazy endless summer i ii never ending story one of my favorites as a kid hearing again i listen to a lot of music to see whats going on with the drums for fun for rehearsal or for education im getting redundant sometimes its nice to listen to some easy folkish stuff with no drums at all just to relax i think my favorite band right now is aloha but there is so much i like to listen to i can list stuff if you want but thats so drab i enjoy most everything from oddtimesignature laden progressive pop like alohamew to good ole fistpimping classic rock bostonjourneystyx to drumless folkyamericanabluegrass ray lamontagnedeb talenthe wood bros and then sometimes its a mos def kind of day i know an absolute ton of music due to my years w an indiancasinoplaying blues band that covered everything from bb king to zz top we played all styles of blues motown country oldies rock n roll some classic rock rhythm blues ballads country waltzs latin rock top you name it wed play it lately ive been enjoying the sweet slowjam of silence tasting sushi gets its own line here favorite thing

better from my grandmothers vegetable garden the farmers market looks amazing right now never say never anything is possible but ill play along wait six things besides the essentials what do i mean by

and last time for everything life on earth is subjective no two peoplethings ever have or ever will experience the same things the same way seriously does my profile make me look fat i think im a good guy im just kinda shy about this okc thing does that make me a creeper i dont want to be that i also spend a lot of time thinking about how gifted i am to be able to perform for people how to be a

including the ones with vaginas i love all the things that make dudes dudes like body hair and smelly armpits and carrying heavy stuff and wanting to fuck everything im a big fan of responsible communicative open relationships such as the one i have with my amazing main manfriend atavacron but i resist identifying as poly i resist identifying in general because i feel like were all always evolving and very few things are absolute i could spout a bunch of relationship philosophy here but meh i talk about sex and relationships ad nauseum so feel free to strike up a conversation oh and sneaking around is antithetical to my nature i enjoying kissing and telling far too much trying to wrap my head around being a grownup at least i found a way to get paid for talking about sex all the time being forthright juxtaposing bigass earrings with generally dudely attire walking in perilously high heels using inappropriate language wasting a lot of time on the internet cutting melons mangoes procrastinating procrasturbating staying up past my bedtime stalking people i know on okc tetrising the other day i ran into someone i knew peripherally about a decade ago she couldnt remember my name but she told me id recognize that smile anywhere ive heard that i have formidable calves people always seem to think im taller than i am one friend claims i have great knees its funny the things people notice i have a pretty epic library which is now mostly in a storage locker im kind of between books right now and taking suggestions for anything hilarious intelligent and riveting the internet is melting my brain comedy over drama any day of the week rupauls drag race is my absolute favorite thing on tv ive also been way into girl gays recently a bunch of mos talking openly about sex and relationships on tv kind of amazing eclectic i care a lot about music but im not the type to present a meticulously curated list of what i like honestly i usually skip this section of your profile i skim it just enough to make sure your taste is broad and leave it at that i cant play favorites with food because then all the other food will get jealous my sense of humor your sense of humor compassion proximity to the ocean sunshine books the fact that there are a gazillion cells all doing their thing in your body all the time the inner workings of the human body are totally mindblowing and fascinating to me ive been told i may talk about this too much portmanteaux especially pervy ones whether i can still call it procrasturbating if im not actually putting something else off whether ill ever start going to bed at a reasonable hour but when im logged into okc i think about why so few people seem to know the meaning of the word formidable and why so many people feel the need to post pictures of themselves dressed as zombies i also wonder why theres an income box why on earth would your salary matter to me im a little fascinated by the ways that people choose to present themselves on the internet drinking i favor dive bars movie theaters you can drink in yay for the imminent return of the parkway s in the park whiskey in the kitchen and a bottle of wine in bed but in my old age i also really enjoy not spending my saturdays in hangoverville i look at your pictures before i read your profile i judge you based on your ability to differentiate between your and youre i dont keep secrets youre a smart ass but not an asshole youre intuitive but not presumptuous you talk shit but youre not a hater youre funny confident smart and good at fixing stuff you like being outside you can appreciate both crappy tv and the literary canon you arent threatened by a girl who cant help flirting nonstop you like making out youre a good mesher you like gossiping about your crushes while were in bed you get really excited about eating you think youre pretty great but youve tempered that attitude with some humility you have a sense of humor about the things you take seriously youre at least a little bossy in the bedroom you noticed that im available rather than single importantly i like to like the people im fucking and know whats going on in their lives and stuff im looking for mutual respect and fondness in addition to hott sexytime you know sexfriends in the sense that both halves of that term carry equal weight i enjoy being able to actually hang out

       "  'so lets get it out up front i am a geekat least according to the fairly classical definition but then a degree in astrophysics phd in physics and a career in research is going to result in me ending up that way or did i end up that way beacause im a geek at the root of everything is that i take great pleasure in finding something out which i didnt know before and the idea of doing research ie finding out something nobody knew before is just cool if im presented with a problem i just cant help but think about it and try and solve it however enjoying finding stuff out does have its disadvantages the flip side to being interested in most things is that i have an opinion about most things and im never happier but when im talking about and dicussingdebating said opionions i cant help it but my opinions just leak out i like to try out new things and im usually prepared to try anything once maybe even twice not that long ago someone used that against me to get me on stealth at thorpe park so maybe i should reassess that i am energetic mildly egomanical and nonlinear so i recently returned to the uk having spent the past years in grenoble in the french alps admittedly it wasnt that far but when you come to france without speaking any french trust me it feels that much further other than trying to learn french im still in research studying high energy astrophysics using nasa and esa space telescopes so i spend myy days trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe or at the very least why my computer code isnt working today well hate to say it but maths and science hence what im doing with my life im rather good at being optimistic in most situations and im loyal to my friends if youre a friend of mine in a sticky situation you cant drag me away i enjoy outdoor activities and hope im reasonably good at some of them the last few years ive managed to make time to get back to a bit of scuba diving climbing and ive finally learned to ski sort of properly the skiing is definately a result of moving to france apparently my mouth and smile but ive never met me so its difficult to say this could be a very long section if i listed absoultely everything as i love my books movies and media you should see the piles of boxes i have in storage since moving films top would be shawshank redemption the usual suspects and pleasantville very different films but each fantastic in their own way but would also have to include iron man the star wars films obviously im a male and b a geek empire records batman begins dark knight returns blade runner garden state donnie darko high fidelity casablanca and gattaca tv it doesnt say tv but im going to through in some shows anyway the west wing i never knew i could be enthralled by american politics aaron sorkins studio was also fun shame it was cancelled bsg house doctor who great fun intelligently written and reminds me of being a kid coupling great situation comedy skins cool edgy new drama books i think the best book i ever read was flowers for algernon although more recently the time travellers wife was amazing everyone should read both bookshave also now had to add the boy in the striped pyjamas also big fan of bernard cornwell tom clancy ian rankin plus phillip pullmans northern lights trilogy is excellent as for music i could go on and on i have very eclectic tastes the usual poprock stuff that everyone knows about fall out boy the fray razorlight the killers etc then theres the classics like rhcp the foo fighters rem then there are just random bands like the wreckers duke special john mayer and jimmy eat world i keep emeaning to learn about jazz but i dont seem to have gotten very far six things okay good friends the people you want to celebrate your victories and commiserate your tragedies with good conversation stimulating company and dialogue there is no replacement for it my pcwith internet connection i hate to say it but in this modern age i feel very cutoff if i lose my technology music talk about soundtrack to your life since getting it a year ago my ipod has rarely been from my side books ive always loved to read although more recently ive struggled to find the time note to self need to find more hours in the day the great outdoors i love the city but i do enjoy escaping all the hustle and bustle ane being outdoors whether its skiing down the mountains or diving under the water its a great way to relax i think few people will remember when this box used to be titled who would you most like to swap brains with does that mean ive been on this site too longnow i seem to be spending too much time thinking about this i spend too much time thinking full stop somethimes i can over analyse things i try to limit it to what is that black hole doing and what should i order at the bar i dont really have a typical friday night it can be simply sat in watching a movie or out cathcing up with friends in the pub i was once voted

       "  'i have read many of these profiles online and they all boil down to one or more of these groups new to online datingand i am not sure what to think of it andor cant believe i am doing online dating can we lie about where we met really are you that selfconscious about online dating just chalk it up to the fact that you probably dont want to date an engineer from the tech company you work for and when you go out to a bar you dont want to be hit on by a guy with an ed hardyaffliction shirt or who has a salmoncolored polo with a popped collar why do we need to lie about it its not that embarrassing is it better than saying we met at dateway or a club that has an adjective for its name like blu or heavy obligatory live laugh love headlineslogan i want to meet the guy or gal that came up with this slogan and shake his or her hand because i never knew that someone can sell so many wall hangings or tshirts with three little words i think there needs to be a guys equivalent maybe grunt scratch sleep dont forget a movie quote preferably a comedy like the hangover every woman is just looking for a nice sweet guy who is funny and smartso long as he is over feet tall oh yeah and money is really no object so long as he makes enough more cliches like looking for my partner in crime or mr right or prince charming let be honestlife isnt a disney movie there is no cinderella and i am fairly certain your name is not esmeralda if you are currently living in sf you must state at least once in your profile how much you love living in the city is that a prerequisite for living in the city funny how people are not as passionate about their city as those women from sf maybe its because they live in the south baywhere dreams go to die bonus points girl you give out bonus points for a certain characteristics this is often used in the context super massive bonus points if you like onelegged cats or triple bonus points if you can teach me how to dougie what are these bonus points good for the world may never know so if you couldnt tell from my profile i am pretty sarcastic so why am i on this dating site simple because i work for an interwebs company and my time is split between the south bay and san francisco its called man jose for a reason and while i do enjoy going to bars i dont think dryhumping at a bar is really the way to a girls heart perhaps i am wrong but i think if i were you would not be on this site i live in the south bay but seem to spend most of my waking hours up in sf i just started at my new company and have not had a chance to move up to sf fulltime yet ive decided that if all the dudes in san jose and all of the single women in san francisco could just meet in the middle say san mateo then the world would be a much better place and single people could actually meet up in the bay area i am sure you have already viewed my profile pics noticeably absent from my photos are the selfportrait shot of me taken in the bathroom sorry why would any woman find this attractive the shot of me in front of my whip i know women love fast cars but really what does that tell you about me other than the fact that i am trying to compensate for something else so for a few cliches of my own so i can join the crowd if you were to interview my family or friends they would tell you that i am funny genuine grounded and family oriented i place a premium on friends and family and do whatever i can to help them out i am a social person by nature and enjoying being around others whether it is at a restaurant a bar a game night at a friends house or a sporting event they would also inform you that i am an optimistic person with a quick wit and is always up for having a good time and loves to laugh i have a passion for life and experiencing it to its fullest as a result i am always willing to try new things from traveling to a new sport to meeting new people and everything in between i am a risk taker as a native of sacramento i left the sunny skies of california to head to the midwest for college i loved every minute of it and am a better person for having ventured out of my comfort zone three years later i lived in london for sixth months it is now a second home and a whole new worldview emerged i am looking for a woman who is fun enjoys traveling is willing to try new things and wants to get the most out of life moreover i would appreciate finding someone who is loyal outgoing caring and kind a woman who challenges me to be a better person and makes me laugh is also a definite plus are you up to the challenge super massive bonus points if you are hangin with mr cooper trash talking about sports good luck if you root for any southern california team or the yankees bring it i have a nice smile like to use it and am pretty funny entrepreneurial ideas and how i can start my own company how many more years will i have to wait until nd is in the hunt for a national championship how i can be a better allaround

the teams diehard fans either loved or hated no middleground and im guessing that a reason why i liked him then was because i also liked eating candy a lot in those years or something along those lines i hadnt updated stuff on here for quite some time the updating is mid july i do currently have a girlfriend shes currently teaching in shanghai im always up for meeting new people though i enjoy all sorts of activities and so often the most enjoyable ones are the simplest least complex ones im a native born san franciscan who loves this city and has lived almost all of my life here part of why i love this city so much is because it has at least a little dose of almost everything and even more importantly it has its own undescribable character unless if were talking about longtime sf newspaper columnist legend herb caen i try to be low key take things slowly when possible and enjoy the little positive things in life like listening to the birds chirping away while walking about after the sun rises and then chirping with them talking with someone ive never met on the streetcarbus and so on i love sports watching on tv listening on the radio playing its about fun not always winning and going to games for going to games i prefer college over pro a lot of its because i went to a lot of college games early in my life and have kept on going to this day im very irish and proud of my deep roots grandparents are from rural western ireland still have a lot of family there i like to travelexplore and it doesnt always have to be far away sometimes the best getaways are right in our own backyard i love public transportation and have since i was very young and a note on muni here in sf it does have its flaws but it deserves a lot more credit than it gets in the last few years i have gotten very interested in local history i enjoy discussing pretty much anything even if its something i know nothing about might as well learn as much as i can while im around i can have very bold opinions on some issues but im always willing to listen and sometimes ill change my opinion thats called being willing to change ones mind due to new info a different perspective etc it is now what a hypocrite does a heads up on match friend enemy percentages i answered questions a long time ago and havent redone them or answered many more of them a lot of times i answered even though what i really think wasnt an option plus i like to evaluate situations on a case by case basis i am animated hella norcal and totally myself for most of i was working for the census quite an interesting experience to say the least and until mid april this year i was job hunting since then ive been working at a grocery store and im liking it a lot i also do occassioanl paid work for the

walks a month but i do more in may and october when we offer a bunch of additional neighborhood walks the walks last from hours i became a guide in may of its funny you pay for a month training class every other saturday to become a volunteer errnow i think its over but hey nowadays volunteer work on a resume is useful all of the tours that i lead are on the west side of the city where ive lived for most of my life enjoying what the bay area has to offer in case if i do move in the near future learning more and more about myself with each and every passing day being a southpaw walking fast

definition for it in your life nobodys perfect everyone has had different life experiences and such were all human just because we go through hard patches in life doesnt mean we should be left alone

what i do sort and i like other people to be the same i prefer peoples actions to be ruled by logic over emotion but am also incredibly emotional so im always trying to find the source of those feelings and sometimes am forced to admit there simply seems to be no discernable cause though i still believe one exists if you enjoy drama are often confusedfickle in your choices or just dont feel

happy and provide what the other needed at the same time im not big into astrology but she was an aries and im a cancer and after the fact i looked into it the whole experience definitely had the

arcosanti i might move back home to the east coast to be with friends and people i miss i might buy a fifth wheel and trade my prius in for a nice diesel truck and just travel and work wherever i want and i might just stay here if i find a compelling enough reason my landlord really wants me to because apparently im an awesome tenant for some reason i hate this section theres nothing i dont want to be even better at except maybe illustration and even that has its facets where i feel i could improve like in emulating certain genres so i have a really hard time qualifying this stuff plus i tend to feel like an egotist patting myself on the back and yes this probably points to some deepseated issue im aware that said i suppose its no fun to leave it at that so ill try im good with spacial

general than i was in my early twenties it took me a while to discover the virtues of extroversion and of really listening to people who have strongly differing views from my own i even have a few friends who are gasp registered republicans and i appreciate their challenging me to think beyond the conventional wisdom of the sf bay area liberal bubble on myersbriggs i started out an intp and am now a nt with scores that hover right in the middle on the introvertextrovert and judgingperceiving scales my extrovert and judging traits are kinda tied together i can spontaneously socialize with people im really close to but for big parties or being out in crowds i need planning and structure i think of the judgingperceiving axis as being something like ordered vs adaptive although i am not religious and am in fact keenly skeptical about religious claims i love traditional church architecture and liturgical music i used to sing a lot of masses and requiems and so on with my college choir i halfjokingly halfseriously sometimes refer to myself as a gnostic pantheist the gnostic part means i think that to know divinity you have to simply experience it personally you cant rely on somebody else to tell you gds will the pantheist part means that whatever gd or divine principle exists hesheit is not a distinct entity with which one can have a conversation but rather is an inherent

to be associated purely with negative screening the firm i work for has its own terminology i was underemployed for a while after i graduated the financial industry in downtown sf had just laid off like mbas yay i worked parttime as a ta in economics and teaching econ accounting operations and finance as a private tutor ive been gradually accumulating courses towards a cpa and may also take some of the financial certifications at some point a series would be really useful for my current job the whole experience has given me a more direct appreciation of how much people at and below the median family income have to struggle just to get by there but for the grace of gd go i i spend a lot of time keeping up on news and politics and trying to learn more about major policy issues interests range from energy and environmental policy to macromonetary issues to abstract topics like parliamentary procedure and electoral systems i am a subscriber to brad delongs rules of punditry rule paul krugman is right rule if on occasion you suspect that paul krugman is wrong refer to rule i also spend a good bit of time just hanging out with my so and assorted friends i did a couple terms as a delegate to the california democratic party during the latter of which i was on the finance committee and served as treasurer of the cdp business professional caucus i wrote a oneword amendment to the state platform in it was a really important word and i generally try to make sure my fellow democratic activists hear about whats going on in the sustainable business community and think about solutions that create green collar jobs and investment rather than simply punitive regulation im somewhat less active in politics lately mostly because im working too many hours at my actual paying

cooking dinner with my sweetie and watching a tv show going out with friends to a movie goth clubbing or even heading to some slightly crazy event like the california academy of sciences lockin thing look up penguins and pajamas for grownups it was fun i wish i were less vain and less pedantic also im bi enough to have an exboyfriend who i still think is a sweet guy but i stopped listing as bi on my profile because honestly every note i got from a guy was more of a blunt comeon than an introduction or query i really hope ive never sent a note as obnoxious as those were i generally dont blare the biness from the rooftops because its not terribly relevant to most conversations but im out the distinction between friends and dating has never made a lot of sense in my head and i can imagine few things more awkward than trying to force the romance of the conventional concept of a first date with somebody id only just met all the people ive ever been involved with i made friends with first and then eventually there was a mutual recognition that we wanted to be something more than that thus i dont list as looking for dates im definitely not looking for just online conversation im too busy if youre looking for online longdistance penpals i probably wont have time to write back to you anyhow im happy to meet new people through okc if theyre actually folks id want to spend time with in realspace so you should message if you dont mind political rants you like sipping port or homemade cocktails while discussing the philosophical underpinnings of pop culture you think hanging out with me and plymouth sounds fun',\n",

that i had been put down a lot growing up and that it forced me to find things that i liked about myself and to focus on those as if my life depended on it in addition i found that there were quite a lot of things that i was naturally interested in and motivated to develop skills in some of which were terrifying like speech and debate singing writing and acting eventually i developed a sort of

marathon in july dnf at mile didnt eat enough food and now im prepping for the disneyworld marathon in florida in january finding continuity errors in my dinner with andre i usually dont keep track of when people first notice me but id guess people usually notice my smile or my eyes or the empty space at the top of my head where hair once sprung from after that id ponder to say my humor and laugh they tend to show up those might be the first things or it could be my nerdy nature coming out too i enjoy monty python and sometimes my absurd humor mechanism is already in full swing much to the delight or terror of those around me i love film ill watch anything i listed favorites here at one time but the list was ridiculously long the short version i love film noir comedies horror indies

       "  'i play with fire i like deep water and i often times swim upstream i ask the tough question i speak confidently to authority and i often times see through facades i tend to catalyze events i leave a big wake and it is often times an interesting life my deepest passion is the environment it acts as the organizing principle for most of the other things that i do in my life im a vegetarian and have been for almost years i do my best to ride my bike everywhere and try to reserve my car for the cases when that is impractical im constantly fiddling with my thermostat to use less less ac or less heat i try to eat organic and local as much as possible and buy a substantial portion of my food at the farmers market even my interest in politics is energized by my strong feelings about the environment for me promoting education social justice appropriate regulation and making fair economic policies are preconditions to dealing with environmental problems i have a strong attraction for practical things executed artistically i love architecture good industrial design for example i have a airstream trailer that i used to live in a mooney ranger airplane and a delorean my own abilities at artistic expression are limited im a burning man veteran and that requires some artistic capability but im not a stand out in that area i can draw competently and ive been told that i write well but even though im taking banjo lessons i can do little more than appreciate music never the less i view my whole life as a piece of performance art and try to bring artistic elements into everyday life i love the way that moma and others make that accessible i just relocated back to the bay area i had been living in austin for the past two year and never really liked it existentialism and the quest for meaning have always been an arc in my life i was given a religion that i later rejected as a child and that gave me a sense of meaning and a direction for the first half of life i had a couple years where i was kind of lost but since that time ive been sorting things out and learning how to have a meaningful life in a universe without a god providing divine purpose i am runner in the great relay of life that goes back potentially billions of years i consider my job in life to promote life all life and help carry it forward into the future maybe ill be able to project my genes and memes into the future but even if i cant i can help carry the burden now my work life is with the operating system on supercomputers i find meaning the fact that im facilitating the scientists struggling to understand the universe i did not have the temperament and focused discipline to be one of them im one of those college dropouts who was too strongly drawn to the glittering lights of the computer industry to stay in school and luckily ive done really well on the computers that ive helped make work weve studied global warming figured out some of the keys to nuclear fusion redesigned fuel injectors so that cars get better gas mileage and run models to help policy makers understand their real vulnerability to tsunamis and earthquakes im also very politically active and support causes with both time and money ive walked hundreds of precincts talked to untold numbers of voters i really care and i dont just sit on the side lines griping about the way things are im involved and engaged solving problems especially computer problems like the maids of yore i dont do windows ive been a linux guy since the old days i thrive on the tough ones the ones that no one else will take the ones are over even my head the old saw that i adopted from my dad the difficult will take some time the impossible will take a bit longer is practically my motto in life cooking if you are into eclectic spicy vegetarian fare youre in for a treat im not a snobby foodie im not into gadgets and im strongly biased toward local organic seasonal foods but give me even a pocket knife a cutting board and an adequate spice rack and youll be impressed writing ive been told that im a rather good writer and clearly articulate complicated ideas that being said the concise brevity so often favored in business communication these days is not really my forte never the less people do seem to willingly wade through the mountains of text that i produce and often remark about the enlightenment that they gain from it im going to have to cop out on that one and gather more data im really not sure the one thing that i have noticed is that people tend to see me as like themselves then are shocked when i turn out to be different than they were expecting books born to be good plan b the political mind before the dawn the ancestors tale shel silverstein where good ideas come from eaarth collapse your inner ape your inner fish dr tatianas sex advice for all creation yeah i read a lot mostly im into nonfiction science and history books but not exclusively movies the princess

mexican chinese indian and thai spicy vegetarian things i have a huge spice rack and know how to use it shows hmm no tv since the early s if you bring something up im probably not sure what youre talking about and ill just nod and smile i do like doctor who though comics xkcd podcasts rocketboom tedtalks science friday radio lab naked scientists the onion and on the media coffee yeah it is a mind altering drug however it seems to alter my mind in the way that i want it to let the artists and musicians have their pot like most in the computer industry im fueled by caffeine arent there supposed to be some antioxidants in there too the news media especially npr and the nyt but also a whole bunch of smaller more targeted news sources bikes i used to say proudly that i have four bikes but no car and that is the way it should be but when i was in tx i finally relented and bought the delorean if youre going have to have a car might as well get one that has some style it is not practical enough to tempt me to use it all the time like a honda would the internet especially google could someone please remind me how we lived before this i sort of remember spending a lot of time in the library and just not knowing things but those are dim distant memories that seem almost like a dream or somebody elses life now open space connection to nature i love flowers and trees and really all plants rocks and geology birds insects and other animals hiking trail running backpacking and staring at the stars something challenging to work on i move from challenge to challenge and get bored when things become easy the environment the overall human condition communication politics and what will happen if we dont overcome ignorance apathy and the disinfomation and start dealing with real problems that we seem to be running headlong into this drives me toward the shallower waters of philosophy im not really good at typical this is friday and im okc last friday i was at a bluegrass concert in portland the friday before that i was in monument valley before that i was out with friends and the week before that i was packing to move get the picture the number of times that i find myself putting on a shirt shorts or sometimes even underwear after im done working for the day is alarmingly high i work from home first of all if youre on a bike in one of your profile pictures youve already got my attention if i have a fetish it is not shoes its bikes i dont want this to be too much of a filter and set the bar too high but im a lot like keuroac the only people for me are the mad ones the ones who are mad to live mad to talk mad to be saved desirous of everything at the same time the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn burn burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes awww if only we could all be like that we all need to pay the bills and we all have to take out the garbage and do the dishes but you need to have a fire in your belly somewhere i think that the best modern approximation of the what he was talking about is burner in the broadest sense burners are not just people that have been to burning man they are people that are burn with passion a passion for something anything if you work for social justice saving animals the environment politics or enable those who do if youre an artist working as a barista or one who lets your freak flag fly or if your passion is knitting cooking or climbing mountains',\n",

the sound of rain massages baths staring out across the ocean kissing giving and receiving flowers champagne and laughter im an episcopal priest my current job is to direct an education program for the episcopal church and i also help out with one of the local episcopal parishes truth is of primary importance to me i seek to empower people and facilitate their relationship with the divine by opening a space in which people can learn more about themselves one of the ways i do this is through teaching a system called the enneagram which ive been teaching for over years i joke with my friends that my superpower is my taste in music im a good teacher facilitator and synthesizer my mind thinks outside the box so is able to make connections where others dont necessarily see them this makes me good at understanding people and situations im grounded and have a nonjudgmental presence that allows people to open up with me im also a good preacher i work at being present and conscious because i seek liberation from old patterns i practice curiosity in my relationships with people because i dont want to lock them or myself into identites that prevent growth im told that i have a nice smile pretty eyes nice hair and a grounded inviting presence people also tell me that im smart however i dont find myself to be overly intelligent there are far smarter people than me i am however willing to say things that others arent and the fact that im good at spotting patterns and underlying tensions in a situation or in people is perhaps why people think of me as smart i would call it being intuitive and attentive books most recently i loved the stieg larsson series and am looking forward to seeing the american versions of the movies mostly because of the director and music

days at a time this winter carving tracks in the tahoe snow care to join whats in it besides some dope who likes to point his ski tips down mott canyon and guide his board through the bumps on milky way bowl could be im interesting to talk to if youre into that sort of thing its not quite that i live to ride but there is a lot of snow up there and my ski share starts real soon now after over years in the same job as a hardware design engineer in silicon valley and years in the computer graphics hardware industry i just started a new job in sf as a software engineer i used to telecommute most days but now i work to at a desk days a week it is intense challenging and pretty exhausting but i have the opportunity to learn a lot mostly from engineers who look too young to shave i did manage to slip in a dive trip to indonesia as i transitioned between jobs so hopefully that will tide me over for a while now that my vacation balance has been reset outside of work when im not playing in the snow i can be found doing sun salutations on my mat making sun valedictions on my bike in the berkeley hills kicking a soccer ball around or massacring some jazz standard on my piano i coached youth soccer for many seasons have done some volunteer tutoring in berkeley and cocaptain an adult coed soccer team so those are a few ways ive spent my time over the years but im going back to a fulltime commute so ive probably had my fun for a bit and then ive spent a bunch of time trying to find a lifepartner and make it work and yet here i am sigh i sustained a really bad ankle injury last fall and soccer still isnt so good for it lately so ive had to make a few adjustments while sidelined i took a manyweekend yoga teacher training class that was eyeopening even if it didnt inspire me to quit my day job i still do yoga a few times a week and ive been roadbiking a lot lately enjoying the climbs and the panoramas from the ridgelines not writing that th word that okc wants me to what is a picture worth these days anyways [this was true for a bit but im pretty sure that th word is now buried of the way down] as it is written now it could be that this profile may make me sound like some sort of stoner jock but im pretty intensely cerebral and not at all a stoner and i think that comes through pretty quick could also be that mensa tattoo i got after too many flaming feynmans thats the best i could do drinks named after scientists came up nil on google im also pretty friendly and will smile at you unless youre after my lunch money my last few reads were the inheritance of loss august freedom chronic city and some stories by richard ford not really eager to embrace any other cultural identity i tend to call myself a reader curiously i wouldnt dare call myself a musician or an athlete but i do probably spend more time doing either of those activities than reading maybe its just that you cant do that professionally still i read just about every day mainly before bed most of the fiction i read comes in the form of paperbacks from whatever random used bookstore i come across my kindle arrived a few months ago so now i read nonfiction the new york review of books and the new yorker all courtesy of amazoncom i love jazz and bluegrass music although admittedly jerry garcia probably appears on more tracks than any other artist in my collection i blow a lot of money on good food and wine and id be in hog heaven and happy to help if i found a partner who liked to cook but i only occasionally cook myself usually i attempt something slightly over my head like feuillet la saucisse the food heading cracks me up how come sports isnt included above clearly a sign of gender bias by the okc robot im waiting for someone to publish a bestselling privlit memoir called eat fart fk one mans search through his jeans pockets to help illuminate my gender a cold beer after yoga trips with my brother croatia castrolandia laos etc the pile of fakebooks on my piano pickup soccer games eggs and toast at cole coffee english premier league what might be on those other channels on my television and what might happened to me if i watched them lately ive been thinking about how mens and womens profiles probably talk past one other on dating sites somewhere above im telling you how i spend all this time chasing a ball or the sun or whatever as if you care and you probably spent all this time telling me how you shop locally live sustainably and care deeply about animals as if i care theres nothing wrong with those things but i suspect youd be happy with someone you enjoy who pays attention to you and id be happy with someone who cares deeply about me i suppose one could also read the text as my way of signaling that im looking for someone active and your way of signaling that youre looking for someone who gives a shit but it seems a little round about recently ive been taking a class but i also like catching live music at small venues and theater performances i take my kindle in the bath with me also i was president of the math club senior year of high school the more embarrassing part is that i really wanted to be president of the math club junior year but i lost the election power so sweet so hard to come by so fleeting most recently i applied for a job at okc and didnt hear back how many different ways are there to be rejected at this site that whole tahoe thing sounds fun and youre up there already need a lift or just got your skis tuned you just want to have a coffee in berkeley or maybe want to cycle up grizzly peak with me you are as comfortable kneedeep in bees as youd be in a suite at the ritz id just be curious to meet someone as marvelously dichotomous as this it also wouldnt hurt if you are fiercely creative in good

particular about the quality of my food but a friend recently told me that i eat like a dog meaning ill eat anything put in from of me with relish not the relish that tastes like sweet pickles although i like that too if i can ride my bicycle sixty or a hundred miles during a weekend it almost never happens ill feel like i had the best of all possible weekends so although im a newly minted geek im also very comfortable in art galleries and love museums etc im just as comfortable dressing up and going to the opera or symphony or the opening of a fancy art show or going to see japanese heavy metal or whatever spare time not getting outside i love movies of all flavors in theaters and on the couch i love fiction and feel disappointed that i have nearly no time to read it any more some more things i love evenings at the ballpark late sunday mornings in bed swimming in the ocean hanging out with my nephew kittens im sensitive by nature especially when others are inconsiderate or impatient but i try very hard to be patient and accept other peoples quirks i try my best to live an honest and straight forward life im not the most outgoing person in the world but neither am i awkward i feel comfortable and engaged in most social situations this life is such a crazy gift i really try to make the most out of every moment while i love to travel etc really i can get a huge rush from the simplest things by just stopping to notice them seeing the same old glow of the sunset behind usf or the smell on my own skin after swimming in the ocean the look on my cats face when she gets bitten by the love bug the smell of a sexy womans hair for a long time i made my living as an art dealer but now work as a software developer for a company in downtown san francisco i feel

not being at work any more while my art expertise is narrow for a couple of years i served as vettor for precolumbian and tribal art at the fall antiques show awesome party i like to think ive got a reasonably good eye in general and can usually think of something fairly intelligent to say about whatever i happen to be looking at the corollary to this expertise that i can be a terrible snob which i hate but ive spent so much time looking at objects critically i have almost no patience for the sort of art that one usually sees at street fairs or at shows in cafes or whatever figuring things out making friends with animals finding restoration on precolumbian ceramics eating i recently took first place in the big splash contest at a marin community pool im a litte rusty but if i practiced a

date are showing interest and im not sure what to do im flattered younger guys are mistaking me for being within their dating range but im not really interested in dating them at the same time guys my age are looking for younger women and i dont want to date guys much older so now what yeah i like going out sometimes but prefer quiet to loud intimate gatherings to big loud parties and social occasions that allow me to speak with people rather than yell or be yelled at i like socializing and i can be very outgoing but see no need to be everyones friend i am often more interested in petting someones dog than talking to the owner people that smile laugh and easily accept others that arent the norm make me happy people that hoot holler and shriek while drunk raise my ire i am more comfortable in a room full of drag queens and leathermen than a room full of straight law students i can deal with the latter but much prefer the former in the end i dont know when or if ill meet a

to do andor want to spend more time doingso that might be a good starting point collaborating on a creative project or coplay in creative activity eg photo excursion dancing surfing hiking camping and other physical andor exploratory activities cooking and experimenting with really good healthy or interesting food that might take a little effort includes throwing dinner parties playing music with others activities that involve with socializing with people in a broader context seeing interesting films and documentaries as well as some bad hollywood cookiecutter films going to technology art and

a great number of physical activities and sports over the course of my lifeif it exists ive at least tried it ive gotten a lot of joy over the past few years from surfing though i only manage to get to the ocean about once or twice a week i also swim dance hike and occasionally will do a bike commute i can also ski skate climb etc but its been a while beyond that i play rhythm guitar and sing i spend a fair amount of time researching current interests as well as random things online i like to cook healthy food and i understand the value sauces im trying to be a better person than i was the day before or last month or whenever figuring things out synthesizing words and images making my friends laugh concocting original refreshing thirstquenching beverages my latest is a juice because i bought a juicer apple cucumber mint lime celery gingerand either spinach or kale i actually have fresh juice almost every morning because its one of my things right now and ive also recently developed an orange colored blend that rocks my world in the small but tiny way that adds up to a good quality of life orange carrot papaya ginger root tumeric root and lemon you of course would be a beneficiary of this goodness if we ever ended up together i have no idea people often comment about the fact that i talk with my hands i recently watched project nim and thought it was really excellent not only was the story movinginteresting but i was impressed by how the film was put together ie the formal approach i also just watched koko the talking gorilla and im reading a book called animals make us human i dont know whats going on but this is where my head is at lately i tend to be drawn to either dramas or intellectually interesting films but then stuff that i think is intellectually interesting other people have said really i didnt get that out of it eg being john malkolvich or the piano the best films of course can be read on multiple levels this is why i think kubrik was brilliant and almodavor and of course hitchcock these are all filmmakers who made good use of some of the other formal levels on which film operates there are too many films to list so this is probably a topic better discussed over coffee but here are from the artists above that made a lasting impression on me plus more random favorites space odyssey matador or high heels to catch a thief true stories harold and maude american beauty some books that left a lasting impression the three stigmata of palmer eldritch the unbearable lightness of being the liars club i watch tv on dvd or itunes mostly just the great drama series that have been evolving on hbo amc and now pbs eg six feet under mad men californication downton abbey music gillian welch various new grass bands jazzy

       "  'i tend to have an optimistic view in life plus an overactive imagination i sometimes keep this to myself but sometimes i just cant resist i can go from shy to super outgoing without any rhyme or reason although i usually love meeting new people and can get hyper when im comfortable i um like like movies im sure i would be down to take long walks on the beach if that is your thing although its not something i tend to do often i am happily married to mandaryn she is seriously awesome if women are more your thing you should totally check her out right now our family consists of cats if they would actually get along they would probably build an army of kittyness that would rule the world instead though one just sits around like jabba the hut the other one sings and the third one is a kitty supermodel hopefully our feline overlords will grant me a small island or something disclaimer i am married and in a poly relationship i realize that most people arent im not going to try to move people over to the dark side or anything unless you mention being open to this on your profile i will just assume you are not so if i actually message you its probably more in a friendship way and not some sinister plot to text my way into your pants mostly working out how to best improve it my brain shoots in many different directions and paths of focus that i tend overwhelm myself in which direction i should go im sure i just heard the sound of a bunch of back button clicks here right now im on a cooking kick possibly entering another gym kick as well it is also about time to bring out the motorcycle and enjoy some roads i have also been just trying to get out with friends more or just looking at any interesting events to go out and socialize i am juggling work as well as going back to school this semester im taking it a little slow and i am just taking sign language i was able to get my soul back from my previous place of employment and now work at a small it company where i am also learning a lot which is nice finding an excuse to break into song although it doesnt quite happen all the time and if i dont know you very well it might not happen at all but i like to make up songs about whatever random situation im in or my cats or nothing in particular i will probably never be up there with freestyle rap artists but its fun i have a ton of things that i have been trying to get better at and get more into unfortunately procrastination is something that i am very adept in ive been told im good at dancing too although really i dont have a clue as to what i am doing i want to work on my cooking skills more i can do some basic things rather well weird things can sometimes cause me grief i can sear a mean steak but i can mess up mac n cheese i am currently working my way to unraveling the mysteries of frozen pot stickers there are work related things i am good at too but i dont think computer dorkyness is going to score me any points on a dating site most likely the fact that i carry around a notepad and rock a lab coat so that i can ask strangers what the first thing they notice about me then i tally it up and post the data on dating sites i honestly have no clue what people notice about me let me check asks room everyone has puzzled look on their face they slowly come to the consensus that it is my tshirts usually hailing from shirt woot or threadless that they notice my wife says its my charming brown eyes i suspect shes just trying to say that to butter me up and put something more physical about me on here i have a septum piercing that usually gets noticed when i actually have it in at some point i will likely have some very nerdy tattoo but i still need to draw it out tv dead like me firefly battlestar galactica dexter party down the it crowd the soup daily showcolbert report are some of the shows that come up at the top of my head i do have a guilty pleasure of some anime series from time to time movies idiocracy saved ferris buellers day off bill and teds excellent adventure anything mel brooks dr horribles sing along blog pixar movies although i havent seen anything toy story the alien series the occasional guilty pleasure involving things blowing up im not really a movie snob i can enjoy things for what they are dont care if it stayed true to the bookcomicscratch paper and i understand that robots blowing the crap out of each other is not the height of intelligent cinema if you want to watch a movie with me i will most likely be willing to see it music industrialgoth synthpop i have a weak spot for depeche mode new order and the pet shop boys as well as newer stuff such as freezepop and ming ping cheesy simple beats and bleeps really get me all giddy trance dj doboy mixes are my favorite s ska i for some reason believe that many problems can be resolved by simply listening to more ska punk alternative i do also have weak spots for s and early s rap comedy music groups as well i feel that i need to throw out the aquabats out there as well books i have been reading way too many technical books and schoolbooks lately the last thing i read was world war z once i get into a book it will suck me in the main problem is finding the book to get into if you have a suggestion for me i would be open to checking it out food i love good food and have been starting to get into beer more wheat beers and framboise are some of my favorites but i have been getting into darker beers as well i blame my wife who will blame her boyfriend its a vicious cycle the pumpkin ale at bjs is one of the most amazing things to enter my mouth i love chinese mexican italian indian american tapas fast fancy lets see what happens when i throw a bit o this an that together the main thing im not a big fan of is fish i dont know a giant trout probably took my lunch money or somethingat some point this year i want to try to pick month and be vegetarian for that month i am not really sure why the heck i am doing this as i love meat more than i even like dessert but i think its more to challenge myself and force myself to think creatively about one of lifes biggest questions what the heck do i want to eat love good friends good food sense of humor internet keeps me occupied and employed what a value oh and dihydrogen monoxide ah ah ah i also spend a bit of time thinking about what would happen if a giant race of string aliens came to rule the world and it was up to the feline population to play and eat them into submission my likelihood of learning an instrument so i can recruit a band to follow people around and do theme music and seriously wtf kind of theme music would i have anyway i also think it would be funny to see real life bust out into a musical bonus points if everywhere i walked people just started breakdancing and there might be glowsticks involved how do you blind someone with science whatever song is stuck in my head also glitter zombies probably either at home doing schoolwork hanging out with some friends playing rock band with chickens or getting a beer somewhere at the gym or clicking around on the internet yup im a wild one im not going to spew out a bunch of random unprovoked confessions about how when i was i accidentally broke pandoras box and unleashing evil upon the world and royally pissing off my parents evil makes a stain on the rug who knew but if there is anything you want to ask i am generally pretty honest and straightforward you dont want to and youre susceptible to reverse psychology you feel that we are either a good match or could be good friends no seriously friends are awesome if it leads to more thats great too enemies might be fun too we can create robots and battle them and every day have some sort of epic battle where nothing actually ever gets resolved but one of us shouts ill get you next time im pretty sure the hate sex could be pretty epic too if you own a motorcycle it would be cool to go on a ride if you get stupid songs stuck in your head are sarcastic funny nerdy and have a mostly positive outlook in life i think we would get along just fine you read that part that i am already in a relationship im not going to do any sort of sneaking around or anything along those lines you are bored and feel like talking to me',\n",

place where i could really start my life and discover who i am as a person im a public school teacher and deeply committed to that access and equity and all that good stuff i am a highly moral person my moral compass points to indignant occasionally im pretty adventurous i have traveled somewhat extensively some of it by myself one of my favorite places has been the cannery i worked at in a small town in alaska where we would hang out at the one bar in town after work and then go watch the bears at the dump another favorite is the greek islands sitting watching the sunset over the caldera in santorini was a moving experience i really felt at home in greece i loved their kefi which is really hard to translate but basically means something like spirit of joy and really connected with that i try to live like a local as much as i can wherever i am i love having old grandmothers try to talk to me on trains im enjoying living in this beautiful diverse city full of architecture and culture that i love im also trying to take my culinary skills to a new level expand them to add as many different cuisines as i can and have it be more of an art form and of course try to see as much live music as is humanly possible careerwise im at the point where i need to decide whether or not im going to stay in the classroom or go for an administrative position its a hard decision because i get a lot of satisfaction from being with the kids i really enjoy watching them grow as young people and as learners since i teach social studies i am constantly trying to make connections to the world around us and it is truly amazing when i see students start to put what we are learning in history together with what is happening around them this is the first summer in a long time that i am not traveling or doing any workshopsseminars so i thought that i would be a tourist here i want to do all those things that i never seem to get around to doing seeing some exhibits eating at some
